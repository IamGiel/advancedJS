#Advanced Javascript in Node JS
## A hangman game functionality, using nodeJS
    
    
Here I used three JS files:

````
profiler.js - takes user info
playFunc.js - gets data set from word bank
checkGuess.js - hangman logic
````
This app prompts the user to provide their information and an option to `play now` or`play later`.  See illustration of sample gameplay:

![Alt Image Text](path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title")
![Alt Image Text](path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title")
![Alt Image Text](path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title")

### Future plans for the app involves:
1. Log-in for previous users/admin
2. Recording "HALL OF FAME" - which is already in place, just needs a little more time to complete, but its a work in progress.
3. Record scores - ties this with HALL of FAME, tabulating user scores and comparing it to other user scores.
